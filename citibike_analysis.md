# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Story Point 1
This page reflects the demographic data of CitiBike users, and New York City and Des Moines residents. The data represented here describes the gender, age, population density, and CitiBike user type for those three population groups.

### User Type
The subscriber data is important to consider in this analysis because it reflects what portions of the CitiBike usage and profits come from a reliable consumer basis. Subscribers are most likely local residents, while "constomers" are more likely to be tourists, for whom we do not have available data to analyze. I would recommend doing an initial financial analysis that only accounted for the subscriber portion of the users to see if local business could support the service without tourist revenue filling in the gaps.

### Gender
CitiBike users are nearly three times more likely to be male than female, while a little over half of workers in both New York City and Des Moines are female. It seems there is not a gendered connection between the work force and CitiBike users in New York City, so there is not a clear reason to believe it would play a part in Des Moines' CitiBike success.

### Age
CitiBike usage by total number of trips and total trip durations are highest in the 18-65 age range. Given the chart on this story point, it is clear that the percentage of residents in this age range in both New York City and Des Moines are nearly identical. Therefore, if age is a factor in CitiBike usage, the population of Des Moines will use the service in a similar manner.

Age is likely more of a factor in predicting usage than gender, as age is more likely to affect someone's ability to do physical activities like riding a bike.

### Population Density
I included a population density measure on this page because I imagine that a large reason CitiBikes are popular in New York City is because the city is very densely populated and the resulting traffic can make car travel too cumbersome. As shown in the pie chart, New York City is far more densely populated than Des Moines. If population density affects CitiBike usage, then I would conclude that there is a lower demand for the service in Des Moines.

## Story Point 2
This page reflects data that I believe affects the demand for CitiBikes: commuting for work and commuting for restaurant patronage. I did not include retail sales data because I considered the practical process of shopping, which is highly likely to result in someone having items to carry home, and determined someone is not likely to use bike transportation when retail shopping. They are likely to bike to work or for a meal, so that is the information shown here.

### Commuting for Work
The commute time to work in New York City is over twice the time of Des Moines. There is no data regarding which CitiBike trips were used to commute to work, so I am unable to provide averages for those trips specifically, but the average trip duration for all rides is 16.30 minutes. If the commute time in Des Moines is reduced by the same proportions with CitiBike, then the average commute time would drop to approximately 7.5 minutes. The shorter commute time is certainly an incentive for Des Moines workers to use the service.

### Commuting for Restaurant Patronage
Des Moines has approximately 2/3 the food and accommodation sales compared to New York City. There is no data to determine how much of these sales are from locals versus tourists, so my initial conclusion is that Des Moines has less of a need for CitiBike in this regard but I would want to find more specific data if possible.

## Story Point 3
This page reflects the usage data for CitiBike to help evaluate times of highest demand (hourly and monthly), and to evaluate how many bikes will need more frequent maintenance. The prior two points in the story offer insight into potential profits, but this page reflects the potential costs.

Based on the data here, it appears that approximately half of the bikes are used more often than others and will need more frequent maintenance. That maintenance would need to occur during the early morning hours (12:00AM to 6:00AM), and ideally during the months of December, January, and February. If organized properly, it is possible to keep enough bikes available to meet the average demand based on the month and time of day.

## Conclusion
Based strictly on the data presented here, I would conclude that a CitiBike service could be successful in Des Moines, IA on a reduced scale compared to New York City. The population and population density are significantly smaller in New York City, so the subscriber base would not need nearly as many bikes. While bike usage is much more common among male patrons, there does not seem to be a connection between the gender demographics of bike users versus local residents. The age demographics for common bike users is nearly identical between New York City and Des Moines locals, which is promising for a Des Moines-based service. 

I think the biggest battle for a Des Moines CitiBike service would be the demand, or lack thereof, among work commutors. CitiBikes reduce the work commute in New York City by approximately 2.5 times, however the reduced time in New York City is barely shorter than the current average commute time in Des Moines. If the goal for the average commutor is to reduce the commute time, then there is a demand for CitiBikes in Des Moines. However, if the goal for the average commutor is something more like reducing the commute time to under twenty minutes, then the demand is not there because Des Moines is already under twenty minutes with motorvehicle travel.

Ultimately, my recommendation would be to invest in a reduced number of CitiBike stations in the metropolitan area with an organized repair schedule that does not impact bike availability.
